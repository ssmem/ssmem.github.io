**Our research project VIRTOSHA (authoring tool for Virtual Reality training simulations of osteosynthesis with haptis feedback und tissue simulation) has finally started!**

Together with Universitätsklinikum Bonn, TH Köln, and Haption, we are aiming to train surgeons with highest quality VR instead of medical preparations (which is the technical term for prepared dead body parts).

To not only solve the academic and technical challenges this includes but to create a real world impact, we are looking for partners that are interested in innovating the field of osteosynthesis.
