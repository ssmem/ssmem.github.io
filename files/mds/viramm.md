**VIRAMM establishes an Extended Reality (XR) Virtual Learning Factory for immersive, interactive, and multimodal training in robot-assisted industrial tasks.**

The VIRAMM consortium of academic and industrial XR and robotics experts develops a comprehensive Virtual Learning Factory, providing trainees and professionals with realistic, safe, and flexible training experiences in industrial robotics. Leveraging XR technologies, VIRAMM enables dynamic, adaptable learning scenarios that overcome the physical limitations of traditional training environments. The platform supports multimodal interaction—including gaze tracking, speech commands, and gesture-based controls—and asymmetric multi-user collaboration, allowing distinct roles for trainees and trainers in the same virtual space.

Building on core contributions from the REACH project, VIRAMM integrates MindPort’s VR Builder with the VIROO platform to create an intuitive, no-code authoring environment for interactive multi-user VR applications. TH Köln’s expertise in Learning Factories and immersive educational scenarios accelerates the design of reconfigurable XR-based training modules, while advanced human-robot interaction (HRI) methods ensure intuitive and effective engagement with digital twins of real robots.

VIRAMM goes beyond current state-of-the-art training systems by combining highly interactive XR experiences with flexible, role-based learning. Trainees can experiment safely with collaborative robots, optimize production processes, and learn essential robotics and process planning skills in a virtualized, reconfigurable industrial environment. The project’s modular and scalable approach ensures broad applicability across manufacturing sectors, improving both learning outcomes and workforce readiness.

Designed for industrial education and professional upskilling, VIRAMM enhances training accessibility, engagement, and effectiveness. Its multimodal interactions and immersive XR scenarios foster deeper understanding, promote reflective learning, and prepare a skilled workforce capable of leveraging advanced robotics technologies in modern manufacturing.
